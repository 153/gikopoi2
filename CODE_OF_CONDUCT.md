We, the developers of Gikopoi 2, hearby pledge to the following community standards:

# 1. We will always treat our fellow Gikobois with a maximum of respect. 
This means no racial slurring, no homophobic or sexist, terrorism, crimes, get each other fired from our jobs or evicted from our homes, 
excommunicated from our religion, expelled from our private fraternal orders etc etc. 

# 2. We will not spam or criminalize the Discord. 
Whereas the [Discord](https://discord.gg/Gg8nWXDgJD) is located at [https://discord.gg/Gg8nWXDgJD](https://discord.gg/Gg8nWXDgJD),
we will not engage in obnoxious repetitive behavior, commit crimes such as calling for the execution of politicians, 
members of the media, shareholders, bankers, members of law enforcement or the judiciary system, religious leaders, 
etc etc. Alternative, non-official channels such as the [Sageru IRC #gikopoi](irc://irc.sageru.org/#gikopoi) ([webchat](https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/irc.sageru.org/#gikopoi))
are moderated by independent operators and communications upon them are not subject to the gikopoi2 code of conduct. 

# 3. We will do our best to make the Official Gikopoi 2 a fun and welcoming place.
Whereas the [Official Gikopoi 2](https://gikopoi2.herokuapp.com/) is located @ https://gikopoi2.herokuapp.com/ ; 
We will do our best to make it a fun and welcoming place. This includes not sexually harassing ko, the wife of Tokiko; 
chatting in Japanese in the International server to troll the International community; falsely claiming that Taiwan is
a free and independent nation, "liberated" from People's Republic of China; etc etc. We want Gikopoi 2 to be a place you
can go to relax and hang out with cool friends, not some place to make people angry or upset.
