FRONTEND:
- ignore keypresses while the user's still moving
- make a class for communications with server
- make a class for assets for a given character


BACKEND
- move the stage data here, so we can do server-side validation for the character position
- use a sequential number for ids instead of those silly string "GUID"s




stuff to add to documentation:
- "logical" position and "physical" position
- how to make graphical assets:
    rules for making assets:
        everything has a width of 160
